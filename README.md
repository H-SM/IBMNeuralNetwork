## Overview
This submission comprises the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Neural Network (NN) models developed entirely from scratch. These models were created as part of an IBM session to delve deeper into the fundamentals of deep learning and gain hands-on experience in building neural networks without relying on pre-built frameworks or libraries.

## Content
### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The CNN architecture is constructed from basic mathematical operations like convolutions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is designed to learn features hierarchically through convolutional layers and extract meaningful representations from input data.

### Neural Network (NN)
The NN architecture represents a simpler, fully connected neural network constructed from scratch. It consists of input layers, hidden layers with activation functions, and output layers. This model is developed to understand the core principles of neural networks, including forward and backward propagation for training.

## Purpose
The purpose behind crafting these models from scratch was to gain a profound understanding of how neural networks function at a fundamental level. By manually implementing essential components such as forward and backward passes, activation functions, and weight updates, a deeper comprehension of the underlying mathematics and concepts governing these models was achieved.

## Note
The code provided here is intended for educational purposes and may not have the optimization or efficiency found in established deep learning libraries. It serves as a learning tool to comprehend the inner workings of CNNs and NNs.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the code provided in the respective directories for CNN and NN. Instructions on how to execute and experiment with the models are included in their respective READMEs.

## Acknowledgments
I'd like to express my gratitude to IBM for organizing this enlightening session, which enabled me to delve into the intricacies of deep learning by building neural networks from scratch.
